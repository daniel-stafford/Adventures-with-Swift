// Identifiable improves performance, requires property of id that is unique
// Identifiable allows us to no longer need to tell a ForEach to identity each item
// Make Codable as to be able to encode
struct ExpenseItem: Identifiable, Codable {
    // unique ID, no need for external UUID library! ðŸ˜€
    // When making codable, , you will see a warning that id will not be decoded because we made it a constant and assigned a default value. This is actually the behavior we want, but Swift is trying to be helpful because itâ€™s possible you did plan to decode this value from JSON. To make the warning go away, make the property var instead of let
    var id = UUID()
    let name: String
    let type: String
    let amount: Double
}
