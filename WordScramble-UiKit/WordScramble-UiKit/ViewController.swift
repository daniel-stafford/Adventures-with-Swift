            // We've already declared that self is weakly owned by the closure, but Swift wants us to be absolutely sure we know what we're doing: every call to a method or property of the current view controller must prefixed with "self?.‚Äù, as in self?.submit().
            // Implicit capture of self in closures is that place when using self is required and meaningful: Swift won't let you avoid it here. By restricting your use of self to closures you can easily check your code doesn‚Äôt have any reference cycles by searching for "self" ‚Äì there ought not to be too many to look through!
