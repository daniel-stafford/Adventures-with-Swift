import SwiftUI

// let us create any number of views inside a fixed grid.
// The first line ‚Äì struct GridStack<Content: View>: View ‚Äì uses a more advanced feature of Swift called generics, which in this case means ‚Äúyou can provide any kind of content you like, but whatever it is it must conform to the View protocol.‚Äù After the colon we repeat View again to say that GridStack itself also conforms to the View protocol.
struct GridStack<Content: View>: View {
    let rows: Int
    let columns: Int
    // closure that must be able to accept two integers and return some sort of content we can show.
    @ViewBuilder let content: (Int, Int) -> Content

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ForEach(0 ..< rows, id: \.self) { row in
                HStack {
                    ForEach(0 ..< columns, id: \.self) { column in
                        content(row, column)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
//        Text("Hello, world!")
        //in a VStack Swift uses TupleView, which contains two views inside) behind the scnes
        //e.g.  hold two views -> public static func buildBlock<C0, C1>(_ c0: C0, _ c1: C1) -> TupleView<(C0, C1)> where C0 : View, C1 : View
        // e.g. tuple that can hold 10 max ->  public static func buildBlock<C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9>(_ c0: C0, _ c1: C1, _ c2: C2, _ c3: C3, _ c4: C4, _ c5: C5, _ c6: C6, _ c7: C7, _ c8: C8, _ c9: C9) -> TupleView<(C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9)> where C0 : View, C1 : View, C2 : View, C3 : View, C4 : View, C5 : View, C6 : View, C7 : View, C8 : View, C9 : View
        //why SwiftUI has a 10 item limit. üòé
//        VStack {
//            Text("Hello")
//            Text("Hello")

       //in the case of four text items, Swift uses ViewBuilder to create a view tuple (again, up to 10), so we're not sending back four things but rather one (tuple)
