    // new class called NSCoder. This is responsible for both encoding (writing) and decoding (reading) your data so that it can be used with UserDefaults.
    // required = if anyone tries to subclass this class, they are required to implement this method." An alternative to using required is to declare that your class can never be subclassed, known as a final class, in which case you don't need required because subclassing isn't possible. We'll be using required here.
