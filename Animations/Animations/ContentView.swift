        print(animationAmount)

        return VStack {
            // Stepp will fill in smooth grap between 1 to 2, 2 to 3, etc.
            // These binding animations effectively turn the tables on implicit animations: rather than setting the animation on a view and implicitly animating it with a state change, we now set nothing on the view and explicitly animate it with a state change. In the former, the state change has no idea it will trigger an animation, and in the latter the view has no idea it will be animated â€“ both work and both are important.
